    accounts for other people if you’re a family organizer, you’re a team administrator or owner, or you belong to a group 
    that has the “Recover Accounts” permission. The person whose account is to be recovered will need access to the email account
    associated with their 1Password account. Learn more here: https://support.1password.com/recovery/"

    require email access/credentials to be made available separately as well."
