# Creating an Emergency Kit for your password vault

If you use a password manager, the task of leaving others with access to your passwords in the event of your death is made considerably easier. Some password managers have functionality for this very purpose, which you can read about here. You also have the option of sharing some passwords with others while you are alive, if the contents are not deeply personal or private, which you can read about here. Another, less common feature that is found in some password managers is the Emergency Kit.

However, even if your password manager does not support these features, or if you'd prefer not to use them, you can use your password manager master password as a simple means of grouping all of your passwords and associated data together in a single password that can be locked away securely until it is needed. Here are some ways that you might choose to do this:

#### Keep it with your will

#### Give it to someone you trust entirely

#### Divide the password(?) See shared secrets
