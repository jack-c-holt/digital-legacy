# [UNNAMED PROJECT]: A Resource For Planning Your Digital Legacy

This website has been created to help as many people as possible take control over the future of their digital possessions, accounts and data when they are no longer able to. Like traditional esteate planning, attempting to take control of your digital legacy can be confusing, time-consuming and overwhelming to go about by yourself. Unlike traditional estate planning, however, you are unlikely to be able to find professional help to do it.

There are many reasons that you might want to conduct this sort of planning. You might have files or data that are password protected and which you would like to be accessible to others in the event of your death. You might be active on social media, and have instructions for the future of those accounts. Perhaps you have relationships with others on forums and message groups, and you would like those people notified if something should happen to you. 

Only you have all of the information necessary to help the friends and family that you leave behind know what to do with your digital things, and it is our belief that passing this information on does not have to be a burdensome task.
