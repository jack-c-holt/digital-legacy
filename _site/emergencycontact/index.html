<h3 id="how-to-transfer-your-password-vault-if-something-should-happen-to-you">How to transfer your password vault if something should happen to you</h3>
<p>Although only a small minority of password managers have so far addressed digital legacy planning directly, several have implemented a feature that explicitly allows for access to a password vault to transfer to another person should circumstances require it. The extent to which this is acknowledged as relating to the user’s death is typically minimal, and in most cases this functionality is framed around the word “emergency”. For that reason, we refer to this functionality here under the umbrella term “Emergency Contact”.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>Implementations of Emergency Contact features vary across password managers, but the process typically consists of the following steps:</p>

<p>1) The owner of the password manager account chooses one or more people to have access to their password vault in the event of an emergency. They will be identified by their email address.</p>

<p>2) The owner then sets a wait time, which is a delay between a request for access and it being granted.</p>

<p>3) An email is sent to those identified, in which they are informed that this has happened. They will be normally be required to accept this role, often by creating a free account with the given password manager.</p>

<p>4) In the event of an emergency, the assigned recipient may trigger access to the account. To prevent misuse, the owner of the account is notified that this request has been made and given the opportunity to cancel it.</p>

<p>5) After the set wait time has elapsed, a copy of some or all of the contents of the owner’s password vault will become accessible to the requesting beneficiary. This copy of the information is encrypted with the receiver’s master password.</p>

<h3 id="does-my-password-manager-have-this-feature">Does my password manager have this feature?</h3>
<p>Across password manager designs, there are some elements that vary. Notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether the feature requires the giver to have a premium account with the service</li>
  <li>Whether the feature requires the receiver to have an account with the service at all</li>
  <li>Whether the receiver is required to accept or otherwise take some kind of action before the emergency contact is officially set up</li>
  <li>The types of contents that can be transferred in this way. For example, whether it includes secure notes or other files.</li>
  <li>The extent to which the giver is able to control how much of their account is passed</li>
</ul>

<p>We keep a list of password managers and details of their emergency contact functionality (and other relevant features) here. If a password manager does have an emergency contact feature, you will find a link to their documentation, which should contain all of the information you need.</p>
