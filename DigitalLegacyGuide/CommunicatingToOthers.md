# Communicating to Others

##  Planned contents

- The most comprehensive plan is useless if it goes uncommunicated
- Having a conversation about this subject is a healthy thing to do and will make the process easier
- You should seek to be clear about what is important to you and what is not
- Consider the burden on others. Your instructions should be clear and direct, with all technical steps clearly spelled out
- For messages that are to be read after you have died, remember and be mindful of the emotional impact of your words


By the end of this section you will have:

- Informed relevant people of their role in your digital legacy, where you have expectations of them
- Prepared clear instructions for your next of kin or executor to be able to carry out your wishes
- Provided information about your general preferences, so that items missed from the plan can be handled (e.g. preference to delete social media pages)
- Kept a copy of your digital legacy plan somewhere safe so that you can review it in the future
