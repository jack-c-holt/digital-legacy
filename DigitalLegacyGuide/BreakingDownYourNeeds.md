# Breaking Down Your Needs

## Planned Contents

- This will be unique to everyone
- For some people this will take only a few minutes, for those with active digital lives it can take a long time
- Even if you struggle to implement your plan fully in section 3, you will be able to leave behind a clear set of wishes for how your digital estate is treated
- This need only be fully done once, but you should return to it on occasion to amend it


By the end of this section you should have:

- Identified for yourself the main digital elements that need some degree of planning
- Specified for each item whether you are seeking its preservation or deletion
- Decided on who will undertake required actions on your behalf and who will receive what
- Decided on the timeframes for the main elements of your plan
