# Finding Your Motivation

## Planned contents

Why this is important:

- Doing this requires time and effort
- It can be uncomfortable to contemplate these issues
- It will be tempting to stop and leave it for another time
- It is easy to convince yourself that it doesn't matter, because nothing matters when you die

What you should remember:

- The effect that a few hours of your time now can have on others
- The difference this can make for how you are remembered
- The benefits of having good awareness and organisation of your data and how it is accessed
- It is up to you how much you choose to plan for

By the end of this section you will have:

- An understanding of what a digital legacy plan can include and how much of it applies to you
- Identified if and why you would like to have a digital legacy plan
- Decided what are the key motivations for your digital legacy planning
