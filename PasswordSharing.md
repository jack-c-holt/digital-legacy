# Using Password Sharing features as part of a digital legacy plan

Due to the very personal nature of planning for death, the value and effectiveness of explicit post-mortem plans will vary. For many, particularly those who are thinking primarily of a partner or spouse, a priority may be to ensure that certain files and accounts that are valuable to both continue to be available if something should happen to one of them. For example, a service that is used by both, but for which there is an account that is set up in one person's name.

For users of password managers, the most comprehensive way of handling such accounts might be to use an Emergency Contact feature, if your password manager has one. However, if you use a password manager that supports password sharing functionality, another option may be to set up your account so that credentials that you don't mind close friends or family accessing are available to them now, rather than only after you have died. Our list of passwords and their functionality available here includes details on password sharing.

We have previously outlined the option of sharing things while you're alive [LINK], rather than planning for them to be transferred after you have passed away. Many of the things that we care about most, particularly photos and videos, are not fundamentally private. Consider setting up a shared cloud storage folder for files and documents that you want others to have when you are gone, but which you don't mind them having now, as well.
