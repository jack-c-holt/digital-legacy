# Overview Of Password Manager Digital Legacy Functionality

[INSERT INTRO]

## Emergency Contact

### How to transfer your password vault if something should happen to you
Although only a small minority of password managers have so far addressed digital legacy planning directly, several have implemented a feature that explicitly allows for access to a password vault to transfer to another person should circumstances require it. The extent to which this is acknowledged as relating to the user's death is typically minimal, and in most cases this functionality is framed around the word "emergency". For that reason, we refer to this functionality here under the umbrella term "Emergency Contact".

### How does it work?
Implementations of Emergency Contact features vary across password managers, but the process typically consists of the following steps:

1) The owner of the password manager account chooses one or more people to have access to their password vault in the event of an emergency. They will be identified by their email address.

2) The owner then sets a wait time, which is a delay between a request for access and it being granted.

3) An email is sent to those identified, in which they are informed that this has happened. They will be normally be required to accept this role, often by creating a free account with the given password manager.

4) In the event of an emergency, the assigned recipient may trigger access to the account. To prevent misuse, the owner of the account is notified that this request has been made and given the opportunity to cancel it.

5) After the set wait time has elapsed, a copy of some or all of the contents of the owner's password vault will become accessible to the requesting beneficiary. This copy of the information is encrypted with the receiver's master password.

### Does my password manager have this feature?
Across password manager designs, there are some elements that vary. Notably:

- Whether the feature requires the giver to have a premium account with the service
- Whether the feature requires the receiver to have an account with the service at all
- Whether the receiver is required to accept or otherwise take some kind of action before the emergency contact is officially set up
- The types of contents that can be transferred in this way. For example, whether it includes secure notes or other files.
- The extent to which the giver is able to control how much of their account is passed

We keep a list of password managers and details of their emergency contact functionality (and other relevant features) here. If a password manager does have an emergency contact feature, you will find a link to their documentation, which should contain all of the information you need.


## Using Password Sharing features as part of a digital legacy plan

Due to the very personal nature of planning for death, the value and effectiveness of explicit post-mortem plans will vary. For many, particularly those who are thinking primarily of a partner or spouse, a priority may be to ensure that certain files and accounts that are valuable to both continue to be available if something should happen to one of them. For example, a service that is used by both, but for which there is an account that is set up in one person's name.

For users of password managers, the most comprehensive way of handling such accounts might be to use an Emergency Contact feature, if your password manager has one. However, if you use a password manager that supports password sharing functionality, another option may be to set up your account so that credentials that you don't mind close friends or family accessing are available to them now, rather than only after you have died. Our list of passwords and their functionality available here includes details on password sharing.

We have previously outlined the option of sharing things while you're alive [LINK], rather than planning for them to be transferred after you have passed away. Many of the things that we care about most, particularly photos and videos, are not fundamentally private. Consider setting up a shared cloud storage folder for files and documents that you want others to have when you are gone, but which you don't mind them having now, as well.

# Creating an Emergency Kit for your password vault

If you use a password manager, the task of leaving others with access to your passwords in the event of your death is made considerably easier. Some password managers have functionality for this very purpose, which you can read about here. You also have the option of sharing some passwords with others while you are alive, if the contents are not deeply personal or private, which you can read about here. Another, less common feature that is found in some password managers is the Emergency Kit.

However, even if your password manager does not support these features, or if you'd prefer not to use them, you can use your password manager master password as a simple means of grouping all of your passwords and associated data together in a single password that can be locked away securely until it is needed. Here are some ways that you might choose to do this:

#### Keep it with your will

#### Give it to someone you trust entirely
